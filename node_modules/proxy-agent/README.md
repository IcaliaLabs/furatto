proxy-agent
===========
### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations

This module provides a function that returns proxying `http.Agent` instances to
use based off of a given proxy URI.

An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for
subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.

The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:


| Protocol  | Proxy Agent for `http` requests | Proxy Agent for `https` requests | Example
|:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------:
| `http`    | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128`
| `https`   | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129`
| `socks`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks://some-socks-proxy.com:9050`


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install proxy-agent
```


Example
-------

``` js
var http = require('http');
var proxy = require('proxy-agent');

// HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use
var proxyUri = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';

var opts = {
  method: 'GET',
  host: 'jsonip.org',
  path: '/',
  // this is the important part!
  agent: proxy(proxyUri)
};

// the rest works just like any other normal HTTP request
http.get(opts, onresponse);

function onresponse (res) {
  console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
}
```


API
---

### proxy(String uri, Boolean secure) â†’ http.Agent

Returns an `http.Agent` instance based off of the given proxy `uri`, and `secure`
boolean flag. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance will be
returned if identical args are passed in.
