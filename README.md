# [Furatto v2.0.0](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto)

Furatto is a flat, fast and powerful front-end framework for 
rapid web development, created and maintained by [Abraham Kuri](https://twitter.com/kurenn) from [Icalia Labs](http://twitter.com/icalialabs). It is based on other frameworks as a start point, such as [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).


To get started, checkout:

#### [http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/) !


## Quick start

Using Furatto is easier than ever, we provided three quick start options:

* [Download the latest release](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/).
* Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:IcaliaLabs/furatto.git`.
* Install via bower: `bower install furatto`.

Read the [Getting started guide](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/getting_started.html) for information about the contents, caveats and more.


## Bug tracker & feature request

Have a bug or a feature request? [Please open a new issue](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues.


## Documentation

We still provide support for version 1.0 as it is a big change from one to another, you can visit the old docs [here](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/old_docs/index.html).

## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

Furatto includes a Makefile to compile all the Sass code and start working with the framework. Before getting started you need to add the necessary dependencies:

```console
	$ bundle
	$ npm install
```

This will install some ruby dependencies like the [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) compiler,
and other node.js packages used to compile the assets.

When you are done, you should be able to run the makefile provided:

####build - `make`

We decided to switch from [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) as some people would not want to pay for it, and just use open source.

## Using Rails?

Thanks to [@kurenn](https://twitter.com/kurenn) the [furatto-rails](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto-rails) gem makes it easy to integrate Furatto with a Rails app.
